**Unit 1: What is Music?** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit investigates some fundamental questions about the nature of
music.  How do we define music?  What, if anything, makes music
different from noise?  How has music been used to create beauty and
represent nature?  How does it act on our emotions?  What notions of
“talent” and “genius” exist in classical music?  What have scientists
discovered about music’s effects on the brain? *  
    
 *In this unit, we will explore some different perspectives on how music
tells stories and expresses and creates meaning in our lives.  Also, we
will explore some different definitions, notions, and characteristics of
classical, popular, and folk music in the West.*

    following questions:  

    1.  In 2-3 sentences, summarize what scientists have found about
        music’s effect on the brain.  How does music alter the way we

        film “Music and the Mind,” in which music acts as a “powerful
        agent of memory”?

**1.3 What Kind of Music?** <span id="1.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: WordIQ’s “Classical Music”**
    Link: WordIQ’s [“Classical
    Music”](http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Classical_music) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read “Definition,” “The Nature of Classical
    Music” and “Classical and Popular Music” to understand some of the
    key features of classical music as understood in Western culture. 
    Designating both music from the classical period in
    eighteenth-century Vienna and any work of music regarded as great
    and long-lasting, the term “classical” can be quite confusing.
     Remember to bear in mind that the distinctions between classical
    and “popular” or “folk” are extremely fluid.
