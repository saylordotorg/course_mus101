**Unit 4: Musical Styles** <span id="4"></span> 
*Style in music is generally the distinctive sound created by an artist,
composer, or performing group. This unit explores the continuum of
Western musical creativity from the medieval period to the twentieth
century, with attention to the social and cultural context for the
development of musical styles.  Subunit 4.1 explores the role of chant
in medieval monasteries and cathedrals and the development of multipart
music (polyphony) in the Renaissance.  Subunit 4.2 focuses on the
Baroque era (1600-1750), with a detailed look at the vocal music of Bach
and Handel.  The Classical style (1750-1820) is taught in Subunit 4.3.
 The next subunit focuses on the development of the Romantic style in
the early nineteenth century, from the piano music of Beethoven to songs
by Mahler.  You will observe how the genre of symphonic  music changed
from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century, as well as the nature of
the orchestra itself, listening to excerpts from Tchaikovsky, Dvorak,
Wagner, and Mahler.  In this unit, you will also learn about the key
musical developments of the twentieth century: musical impressionism,
modernism, and postmodernism, focusing on the music of Debussy, Ravel,
Stravinsky, Copland, and Cage.  This course concludes with a review of
the various styles and time periods of Western music history. *

    Mozart’s letters to his father Leopold Mozart grouped under the
    heading “Concerning the Opera.”  Please read this text to get a
    sense for the inspirations behind Mozart’s opera and the novel
    approach to music drama and techniques of setting speech to music
    that Mozart developed in such works as *Don Giovanni* and the
    *Marriage of Figaro*.  Consider Mozart’s famous dictum from one of
    these letters, “in opera, poetry must be the obedient daughter of
    the music.”  How did this represent a shift from Baroque
    aesthetics?   Also, how do Mozart’s letters detailing his struggles
    to make a living reflect the shifting role of the composer in the
    classical period?

    you listen, consider the meaning of this work in the context of the
    social, political and cultural upheavals taking place at the time
    Schoenberg wrote *Pierrot* in 1912.  Pierrot himself is a stock
    comic character from the Italian *commedia dell’arte* tradition.  As
    you view this video, also consider the following questions:  
        
     How does Schoenberg make use of this character to convey meaning in
    the work?   What are the emotional and psychological effects of the
    *Sprechstimme* (“speech-voice,” the style of singing called for
    throughout the piece)?  Schoenberg was sympathetic to the aims of
    expressionism, an artistic movement of the time that sought to give
    voice to the subconscious, and to reveal the dark side of human
    emotion.  In what way is *Pierrot* successful as a work of
    expressionist art?
