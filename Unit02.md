**Unit 2: Learning to Listen** <span id="2"></span> 
*Music communicates emotions and ideas, telling stories through sound. 
Composers and musicians work with the building blocks of sound: pitch,
rhythm, dynamics, texture, and tone color, which is the quality of a
musical sound.  Organizing these elements to create a whole, or the art
of large-scale design, allows artists to create what we call musical
form.  The choices that composers make in their music are not only
highly personal and intuitive but contingent on cultural traditions and
norms.  Musical instruments were created to extend the capacity of the
human voice and body. *  
    
 *In this unit, we will explore the elements of music and principles of
formal design, and we will become familiar with the vocabulary used to
describe and analyze music.  Learning the language of music will enable
you to sharpen your listening skills as well as your appreciation of
music. *

     Instructions: Listen to both lectures (mp3) or view the videos via
    Flash or QuickTime (approximately 50 minutes for Lecture 3 and 45
    minutes for Lecture 4) to deepen your knowledge of how rhythm works
    in music.  Try to get a sense of how meter, syncopation, tempo, etc.
    contribute to the mood and feel of a musical work, as well as the
    different ways in which jazz, pop, and classical composers have used
    rhythm.  In Lecture 3, students are taught to conduct basic patterns
    in these meters through musical examples drawn from Chuck Mangione,
    Cole Porter, REM, Chopin, and Ravel.  In Lecture 4, Professor Wright
    begins this lecture with a brief introduction to musical acoustics,
    discussing the way multiple partials combine to make up every tone.
    He reviews fundamental rhythmic terms, such as "beat," "tempo," and
    "meter," and then demonstrates in more depth some of the more
    complex concepts, such as "syncopation" and the "triplet."
     Professor Wright then moves on to discuss the basics of musical
    texture, giving detailed examples of three primary types:
    monophonic, homophonic, and polyphonic. At the conclusion of the
    lecture, Mozart's *Requiem* is shown to weave different rhythms,
    textures, and pitches together to depict the text effectively.

    forth a historical, technical, and holistic approach to
    understanding the way pitches and scales work in music.  He
    concludes his lecture by bringing pitch and rhythm together in a
    discussion of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read this webpage in its entirety to learn
    about chord progression, which is a series of chords played one
    after another.  In many types of Western music, from Baroque to the
    blues, there are specific chord progressions that are used over and
    over again and are easy to recognize in certain types of music that
    have repetitive phrase structures.  To hear some of these, play the
    musical examples in the Wikipedia article.

     Instructions: Please view this brief video in its entirety
    (approximately 3 minutes).  We can easily hear chord changes in a
    specific type of 1950s and 1960s popular music called doo-wop.  The
    harmony for doo-wop melodies consisted of short chord progressions
    repeated over and over again.  In Gene Chandler’s 1962 hit “Duke of
    Earl,” there are four chords in the progression, which change every
    four beats.  In other words, every fourth beat coincides with a new
    chord (an easy way to hear this is to listen for the word “Earl”). 
    Listen to hear the chord changes and try to sing along.

     Instructions: Listen to the lecture (mp3) or view the video via
    Flash or QuickTime (approximately 50 minutes) for a discussion of
    the fundamental workings of harmony in music.  Professor Wright
    discusses the ways in which triads are formed out of scales, the
    ways that some of the most common harmonic progressions work, and
    the nature of modulation.  Professor Wright focuses particularly on
    the listening skills involved in hearing whether harmonies are
    changing at regular or irregular rates in a given musical phrase.
     His musical examples in this lecture are wide-ranging, including
    such diverse styles as grand opera, bluegrass, and 1960s American
    popular music.

    of music.  These versions are called variations.  Listening to
    Benjamin Britten’s *The Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra* can
    serve two valuable purposes: to learn the tone colors of the Western
    orchestra and to introduce important concepts of covered in our next
    unit: theme and variation, fugue, and formal design in music.  In
    this piece, Britten introduces a short tune by an earlier British
    composer, Henry Purcell.  At the end, Britten writes an energetic
    fugue, based on yet another version of the Purcell tune.  Astute
    listeners will also note that the tune wraps in a variety of A B A
    form, a symmetrical, three-part form introduced in the next unit.
