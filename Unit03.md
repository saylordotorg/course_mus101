**Unit 3: Musical Structure** <span id="3"></span> 
*This unit deals with formal elements of design—the shape, arrangement,
relationship, or organization of the various elements of music. 
Building on the basics of melody, harmony, and rhythm from Unit 1, we
begin with a common variety of harmonic progressions—bass patterns
consisting of simple chord progressions.  As we will see in musical
examples taken from Mozart, Beethoven, the Beach Boys, the Dave Matthews
Band, and Justin Timberlake, composers from both the classical and
popular music worlds draw on the same bass patterns.  By analyzing
longer works, we examine the large-scale forms used in popular and
classical music: verse-chorus, sonata-allegro, fugue, and theme and
variations form.  We will briefly explore the manifestations of some of
these forms in literature, painting, and other disciplines.  This unit
will end with a review of all the forms discussed in the lectures and
readings.*

     Instructions: Listen to the lecture (mp3) or view the video via
    Flash or QuickTime (approximately 48 minutes) to learn how to listen
    for bass patterns in order to understand harmonic progressions.
     Professor Wright presents numerous musical examples from both
    popular music and classical music, showing the way that composers
    from both realms draw on the same chord progressions.  The musical
    examples are taken from Mozart, Beethoven, Rossini, Wagner, Gene
    Chandler, the Beach Boys, Badly Drawn Boy, the Dave Matthews Band,
    and Justin Timberlake.

**3.2 Introducing Form in Music** <span id="3.2"></span>

    Link: Connexions: Anthony Brandt’s [“Musical
    Form”](http://cnx.org/content/m11629/latest/) (HTML and Adobe
    Flash)  
        
     Instructions: Please read both sections on music form: “Grasping
    the Whole Composition” and “Labeling the Parts,” as well as the
    conclusion.  Click on the links to hear the musical examples in
    Flash, and try to solve the problems by clicking choice A or B.  
    Listening for musical form is hearing the “big picture” of a piece
    of music.  Students learn to experience a musical composition as
    divided into sections, which Brandt compares to the layout of a city
    divided into neighborhoods.  In an A-type form, the focus is on
    continuity; in an A/B-type, the focus is on contrast. To access the

    classical music, focusing particularly on ternary form and
    sonata-allegro form.  Throughout his detailed explanation of
    sonata-allegro form, he also elaborates upon some harmonic concepts
    describing, for example, the relationship between relative major and
    minor keys.  This lecture draws its musical examples from 'N Sync,
    Mozart, and Beethoven.

    depth in this lecture.  He focuses especially on characterizing four
    types of music found within a sonata: thematic, transitional,
    developmental, and cadential.  He then moves on to discuss a
    different form, theme and variations, which is accomplished through
    the use of examples from Beethoven's and Mozart's compositions.
     Professor Wright and guest artist Kensho Watanabe then conclude the
    lecture by demonstrating a set of theme and variations through a
    live performance of Arcangelo Corelli's *La Folia*.

    disciplines, and then gives a detailed explanation of how fugues are
    put together in music.  Though he uses excerpts by composers as
    disparate as Georges Bizet and Leonard Bernstein to illustrate his
    points, he draws his main musical examples from J.S. Bach.

     This lecture begins with a review of all the musical forms
    previously discussed in class: sonata-allegro, rondo, theme and
    variations, and fugue.  Professor Wright then moves on to discuss
    the final form that will be taught in this course: the ostinato or
    persistently repeating pattern in music.  With the aid of music by
    Pachelbel, Purcell, and a few popular artists, Professor Wright
    shows the multitude of ways in which the ostinato bass has been used
    throughout the past several centuries.
