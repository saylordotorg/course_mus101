Course Syllabus for "MUS101: Introduction to Music"
---------------------------------------------------

This course provides an introductory survey of the Western classical
tradition, exploring music both as a phenomenon of sound and culture.
 The focus of this course is the development of aural skills that lead
to an understanding and appreciation of music.  Making use of live
performances and streaming audio available on the Internet, we will
listen to and explore some of the most important and influential
repertoires and genres of music that emerged in the last four centuries:
High Renaissance vocal music, the cantatas and oratorios of Bach and
Handel, Mozart’s comic operas, the monumental orchestral works of the
Romantic movement, and the major musical movements of twentieth-century
Europe and America, revealing significant connections with contemporary
pop and jazz styles.  These styles have become an enduring part of the
world of music in the twenty-first century, traveling out of the concert
hall and conservatory into the larger world via movies, television, and
the Internet. This course will begin by studying the fundamentals of
music, developing a working definition of music.  You will then learn
listening skills and musical elements that will be useful as you survey
samples of famous compositions throughout this course.  Lastly, you will
be grounded in the historical contexts for Western classical music.  You
will learn to make connections between the distinctive styles and the
cultural, historical, and social factors that influenced them.  By the
end of this course, you will have a greater knowledge and appreciation
of the history, aesthetics, techniques, forms, and genres of Western
classical music.

### Course Information

Welcome to MUS101.  Below, please find some general information on the
course and its requirements.

**Course Designer:** Marion Jacobson

**Primary Resources:** MUS101 makes use of a variety of free, online
musical materials, learning tools, and videos.  However, this course
makes primary use of the following:

Open Yale Courses:  Professor Craig Wright’s “[Listening to
Music](http://oyc.yale.edu/music/listening-to-music)”  
    
 Connexions:  Anthony Brandt’s “[Sound
Reasoning](http://cnx.org/content/col10214/latest/)”  
    
 National Public Radio’s [Milestones of the Millennium
Series](http://www.npr.org/programs/specials/milestones/990101.motm.intro.html)  
    
 The San Francisco Symphony’s “[Keeping
Score](http://www.keepingscore.org/)”  
    
 It is suggested that students bookmark this site, an online reference
work containing all the musical terminology used in this course:  
    
 Virginia Tech Multimedia [Music
Dictionary](http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/)

**Requirements for Completion:**  In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Please give focused attention to Units 1 and 2, which lay the groundwork
for understanding the building blocks of music.  You will also be
expected to complete Vocabulary Worksheets and Learning Journals for all
four units of the course.  The Vocabulary Worksheets should help you
recall musical vocabulary.  The Learning Journals invite you to record
your responses to the listening assignments in the course and give you
the opportunity to apply your musical vocabulary and knowledge. Taken
together, these assignments will become a unique record of your thinking
and learning about music in this course.

In addition, you will need to complete additional written assignments
for this course:

You will need to complete The Saylor Foundation’s four Guided Listening
Assignments.  Each of these entail short written responses to focused
listening of selected major works from the course:

-   Guided Listening 1: Mussorgsky’s *Pictures at an Exhibition*
-   Guided Listening 2: Handel’s *Messiah* Libretto and Study Guide
-   Guided Listening 3: The Art of the Symphony in Beethoven’s *Symphony
    No. 5* in C Minor
-   Guided Listening 4: John Cage and Postmodern Musical Aesthetics

There will be additional written assignments that will challenge you to
think more broadly about the changing role of music in society:

-   Assignment 1.3 The Saylor Foundation’s “What Is Classical Music?”
-   Assignment 4.1.1 The Saylor Foundation’s “The Gregorian Chant”
-   Assignment 4.1.3 The Saylor Foundation’s “Secular Music in the
    Middle Ages”
-   Assignment 4.1.5 The Saylor Foundation’s “The Renaissance Madrigal”
-   Assignments 4.3.2 The Saylor Foundation’s “Study Guide for Milos
    Forman’s *Amadeus*” and  “Music and Society in Eighteenth Century
    Europe
-   Assignment 4.5.1: The Saylor Foundation’s “Music and Modernism in
    the 20<sup>th</sup> Century: Stravinsky’s *Rite of Spring*
-   Assignment 4.6: The Saylor Foundation’s “Final Course Reflections
    Essay”

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all the assignments listed above.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment:**  This course should take you approximately a total
of **109** hours to complete.  That includes the time needed to listen
to each musical example once through, though it is recommended that you
listen to a music sample at least two or three times.

Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of time you
are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help you plan your
time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at these time
advisories and to determine how much time you have over the next few
weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For
example, Unit 1 should take you 10 hours to complete.  Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 and 1.2
(a total of 4 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.3 (a total of 2 hours)
on Tuesday; etc.

Perhaps you can set aside several hours a week for listening to material
related to the course, and keep a record of your listening experiences
(you can use the four unit-based Learning Journals for this purpose).

**Tips/Suggestions:**  It would be helpful to print out your Vocabulary
Worksheets and Learning Journals and have them on hand in a three-ring
binder for this course.  If you do not have access to a printer, cut and
paste all of the material into a single word document and save it in an
accessible place on your computer.  As you listen and read, take notes
on a separate sheet of paper or on your computer.  Note any important
terms and concepts that stand out.  Use your notes—and the Learning
Journals—to review for the Final Exam.

The Saylor Foundation recommends that you listen to each music sample at
least two or three times and that you set aside a quiet place and time
for focused listening.  It may also be helpful to use headphones when
listening to each of the musical selections for this course.  Many
students find that the use of headphones offers a more focused listening
experience.

It is recommended that you listen to some of the music from the course
every day during the time period you have set aside to study for
MUS101.  To enhance your knowledge of the material, we also encourage
you to listen to other representative works from the Western classical
music tradition.  Quite a number of these can be found on YouTube, and
[MusOpen](http://www.musopen.org/), which offers free classical music in
the public domain.  We also recommend that you tune into your local
classical radio station.
